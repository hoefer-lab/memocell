maybe just show some nice plots here of what is possible with MemoCell and
link to jupyterlab examples on github for code and usage details;
remember to also upload jupyterlab examples in html so that there easy to open and
view in the web (if possible; otherwise see scanpy where they demonstrate all
examples with read the docs code sections)

Data Handling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Parameter Estimation and Model Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Progress bar: should show up, if not maybe `install the jupyterlab extension <https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_install.html#installing-the-jupyterlab-extension>`_.


MAYBE REMOVE THIS FULL PART; and add above progress bar note to
jupyter code examples

MemoCell
========

An exact modelling framework for stochastic processes with and without memory in Python.

Getting Started
===============

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

MemoCell requires an installation of a recent Python version; Python can be installed via `Anaconda <https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/>`_.

Make sure to have ``graphviz`` and ``pygraphviz`` installed before installing ``memocell``; for example by executing the following in the terminal::

   conda install graphviz
   conda install pygraphviz

Then ``memocell`` can be installed by running::

   pip install memocell

Other dependencies should be installed automatically during the ``memocell`` installation.

hi maurice, das hab ich aufgeschrieben waehrend dem gm:

"occur" pronunciation

"estimate" verb vs noun pronunciation

a)

mean time is more natural than Î¸ here.

choose the same mean for the wt distribution to make the difference
(shape) more transparent?

"sample variance" to indicate that these are still random variables

d)

too much visual weight for the argument -> supplement

e)

latex font for the shown moment equations clashes with font for the rest.

grey arrows are a bit small

angle brackets instead of E[..] ? matter of taste, but this would be
more compact

how to get mean and variance from moments is basic algebra -- may not
merit a depiction.

about gaussian likelihood:

i think it's not problematic because your models can only produce
reasonable, positive variances. the fact that the likelihood does not
exclude unphysical solutions explicitly, is therefore not important.

about the error covariances: in general the values at different times
will be correlated, and this is a relevant feature of the biological
process that generates the data. you could in principle estimate all the
error correlations, probably not statistically less defined than the
error variances themselves. the gaussian likelihood that respects these
error correlations is also relatively simple, and numerically not
problematic, i think. this extension of the framework would be
relatively little effort i therefore think. maybe something for the
future or for version 2.0

h) double-check definition of bayes factor (i think i have seen
something different than evidence/max.evidence.

e) i didn't get why there is no experimental data for the division time?
no continuous cell tracking?


f) aspect ratio 1:1 is better

c) linear interpolation make no sense? better to do it stepwise?
